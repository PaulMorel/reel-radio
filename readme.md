# Rocksmith Web UI Experiment
## About
The Rocksmith Web UI experiment is a personal projet centered around learning how to use version control, Git and GitHub. At the same time it serves as a playground for design, HTML, CSS and Javascript experiments.

It's based off of the Ubisoft's game Rocksmith.
